      "message": "I have an issue with the two ONOS ports above\nTheir values are not correct because these mirrored ports are not reachable from outside the cluster. The only ports that are reachable are the forwarded ports during kind-voltha deployment.\nThe sanity test only works because we define/override these values with the ones specified as arguments on the robot test invocation in the jenkins job i.e.\nrobot -v ONOS_REST_PORT:8181 -v ONOS_SSH_PORT:8101 .....\n\nIn my functional test cases I use the new \"Lookup Service PORT\" APIs to correctly find their values",

      "message": "the ports specified here are the \"nodePorts\" set by the helm chart. I, personally, don\u0027t think charts should be using nodePorts as that is not the proper way to expose a service in a production deployment. Instead an ingress controller should be used.\n\nkind-voltha exposes the service ports on the localhost (which is also not how it would be done in a production deployment but at least it is the same port).\n\nAre you questioning what the default values should be?",
