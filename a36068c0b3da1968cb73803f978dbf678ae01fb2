Also, currently, this will not affect anything as there is no bbsim make target for this TC. May be we can add a comment why this value. Let me know if I am missing something here.",

Andrea gave me the hint that \u0027mcast\u0027 is set by https://github.com/opencord/pod-configs/blob/master/deployment-configs/flex-ocp-cord-TT.yaml which is used in https://jenkins.opencord.org/view/VOLTHA-2.X-Tests/job/build_flex-ocp-cord_TP_voltha_TT_master_test/  (see comment by Andrea). So both of us decide to keep it \u0027mcast\u0027 to do not endanger the named tests.",
