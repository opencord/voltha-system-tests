# Tests can be enabled by passing the following tags:
# - [setup] Creates and enable the OLT devices
# - [activation] Checks that ONUs are active in VOLTHA and ports discevered in ONOS
# - [flow-before] Checks that flows are pushed (before subscriber provisioning)
# - [authentication] Checks that subscribers are correctly authenticated
# - [provision] Provision the data-plane flows for all the subscribers
# - [flow-after] Checks that flows are pushed (after subscriber provisioning)
# - [dhcp] Checks that subscribers have received an IP
#
# To run the full test:
#   robot Voltha_Scale_Tests.robot
#
# To run only ceratain tests:
#   robot -i activation -i flow-before Voltha_Scale_Tests.robot
#
# To exclude only ceratain tests:
#   robot -e -i flow-before Voltha_Scale_Tests.robot
#
# Once te test complete you can extrapolate the results by using
#   python extract-times.py
