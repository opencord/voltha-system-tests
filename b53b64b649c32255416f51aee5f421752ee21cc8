      "message": "Hi Torsten, I don\u0027t understand the purpose of `etcd_check` flag. At first, it is getting set to False here in the `Setup Suite` then in `Setup Test` (which gets called for each test) it gets set to True (we have not done anything specific in between, related to this flag). Then again in `Teardown Test` (which gets called for each test) it changes to False directly and then finally in `Teardown Suite` we use it as IF case where as per my understanding it will always be False. Please let me know if I am missing something here. Thanks.",
