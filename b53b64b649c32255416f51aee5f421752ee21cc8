      "message": "Hi Torsten, I don\u0027t understand the purpose of `etcd_check` flag. At first, it is getting set to False here in the `Setup Suite` then in `Setup Test` (which gets called for each test) it gets set to True (we have not done anything specific in between, related to this flag). Then again in `Teardown Test` (which gets called for each test) it changes to False directly and then finally in `Teardown Suite` we use it as IF case where as per my understanding it will always be False. Please let me know if I am missing something here. Thanks.",

      "message": "Ack\nYou (and also Michael) are absolutly right. My intention to keep the old behaviour (etcd check in suite teardown) and the realization did not match. So I introduce a new flag, which can be set via the -v option of robot. With this flag the user can decide to execute etcd check in test teardown (default) or in suite teardown (see patchset #3). All the test internal toggeling of a flag is removed. Thanks",
