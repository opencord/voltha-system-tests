      "message": "Thanks Michael. Yes, I agree with your point that we need a way to verify the actual state of the image in ONU. Not sure, if there is a way for that in bbsim at the moment, Teo can help to understand this. For now, as suggested, I will add a static sleep after activate command. I guess 30 seconds should be enough. Your thoughts?",
