      "message": "Based on this line, I am wondering if we need to set BBSIM_OLT_SN and BBSIM_ONU_SN in the variable file. Might we just look this up after we create the device? This would mean one less \"statically configed\" value when invoking the test and might make it easier to run against multiple targets (old bbsim, new bbsim, various real hardware)",

      "message": "That is why I did this. I\u0027ve seen different Sadis files that had uncommon values for BBSIM_OLT_SN. What was common was the uplink port it was using which did not change.\nAs for the BBSIM_ONU_SN, I trying not to break anything in the sanity test but in fact I\u0027m not using this value as for my Functional test cases, I\u0027m dealing 16 ONUs and hence a list of ONU_SNs",
