But, there is another option where we can create a new soak_tests.robot file and move it there (because later we will add more specific tests that will be executed on the soak platform), we can follow this approach too and update the soak test pipeline accordingly.",

In future, if we plan to implement soak specific scenarios in a different soak suite, then this can be moved as required.\n\n@Teo: BBSim is added to deployment file but separately. The data entered under `olts` gets part of active testing whereas in this iteration BBSim deployment is only for load purpose. The Soak is a long work which will have many submissions and in future the plan is to make BBSim also as part of active testing (i.e system under test), then it can be included under olts and behave like actual multi-olt test. But that will take some investigation and work in voltha-system-tests repo, and I will take that as a separate task.",
